I learned this game from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w

I updated my game with introducing Levels. 

If the level increases, the speed of the enemy increases. The level you get depends on the score. For example, if the score < 5, you are on level 1, and continuing on.

Hope you enjoy playing this game.
